    "\n",
    "Every optimisation problem has two parts:\n",
    "* **Parameters**, the things that can be adjusted.\n",
    "* **Objective function**, which measures how good a particular set of parameters are.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimisation problem usually also has:\n",
    "* **Constraints**, that define the feasible set of parameters.\n",
